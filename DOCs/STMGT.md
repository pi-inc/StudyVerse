# State Management Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the state management strategy for the StudyVerse app.

## 2. Technologies

*   **Local State:** Zustand
*   **Global State:** Zustand
*   **Server State:** React Query
*   **Persistence:** zustand/persist

## 3. Local State Management

*   Zustand will be used for managing local component state.
*   The `useState` hook will be used sparingly for very simple UI-related data.
*   Zustand stores will be created for components that require more complex state logic or need to share state with other components.

## 4. Global State Management

*   Zustand will be used for managing global application state.
*   A global Zustand store will be created to hold data that needs to be shared across multiple components (e.g., user authentication status, course data).
*   Selectors will be used to access specific parts of the global state.
*   Actions will be used to update the global state.

## 5. Server State Management

*   React Query will be used for managing server-side data.
*   React Query will be used to fetch, cache, synchronize, and update data from the backend API.
*   Queries will be used to fetch data.
*   Mutations will be used to update data.
*   Caching will be configured to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary API requests.

## 6. Persistence

*   zustand/persist will be used to persist state across sessions.
*   The zustand store will be persisted to AsyncStorage (React Native's built-in storage solution).
*   User preferences (e.g., theme, language, notification settings) will be persisted.

## 7. Store Structure

*   A separate Zustand store will be created for each major domain in the application (e.g., user, courses, lessons).
*   Each store will contain the following:
    *   State: The data that the store manages.
    *   Selectors: Functions for accessing specific parts of the state.
    *   Actions: Functions for updating the state.

## 8. Example

```javascript
// User Store
import create from 'zustand'
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware'

let userStore = (set) => ({
  user: null,
  setUser: (user) => set({ user: user }),
})

userStore = persist(userStore, {
  name: 'user',
})

const useUserStore = create(userStore)
