# DevOps Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the DevOps strategy for the StudyVerse app.

## 2. Technologies

*   **Hosting:**
    *   Frontend: Firebase Hosting
    *   Backend: Firebase Cloud Functions
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
*   **Monitoring:** Firebase Performance Monitoring

## 3. Hosting

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Firebase Hosting will be used to host the frontend of the app.
    *   The frontend code will be deployed to Firebase Hosting using GitHub Actions.
    *   Firebase Hosting will provide a global CDN for fast content delivery.
*   **Backend:**
    *   Firebase Cloud Functions will be used to host the backend API.
    *   The API code will be deployed to Firebase Cloud Functions using GitHub Actions.
    *   Firebase Cloud Functions will automatically scale based on traffic.

## 4. CI/CD

*   **GitHub Actions will be used for CI/CD.**
    *   A GitHub Actions workflow will be created to automatically build, test, and deploy the app whenever code is pushed to the main branch.
    *   The workflow will perform the following steps:
        *   Checkout the code.
        *   Install dependencies.
        *   Run tests.
        *   Build the app.
        *   Deploy the app to Firebase Hosting and Firebase Cloud Functions.

## 5. Monitoring

*   **Firebase Performance Monitoring will be used for monitoring.**
    *   Firebase Performance Monitoring will be used to track the performance of the app and identify any issues.
    *   Alerts will be set up to notify developers of any performance regressions or errors.

## 6. Scaling

*   The app will be designed for horizontal scaling.
*   Firebase Cloud Functions will automatically scale based on traffic.

## 7. Security

*   Security best practices will be followed throughout the DevOps process.
*   Code will be scanned for vulnerabilities using static analysis tools.
*   Dependencies will be kept up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities.
