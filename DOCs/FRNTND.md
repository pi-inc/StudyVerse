# Frontend Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture, technologies, and implementation details for the frontend of the StudyVerse app.

## 2. Technologies

*   **UI Framework:** React Native (with React Native Web)
*   **UI Library:** Ant Design Mobile RN
*   **Navigation:** React Navigation
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

## 3. Architecture

The frontend will follow a component-based architecture, where the UI is broken down into reusable components.

*   **Component Structure:**
    *   Each screen will be a separate component.
    *   Reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, inputs, cards) will be created as separate components and used throughout the app.
    *   State management will be handled using a combination of local component state and a global state management solution (Redux or Zustand - to be decided later).

## 4. Navigation

The app will use a blended navigation approach:

*   **Main Navigation (Tabs):** A tab bar at the bottom of the screen will provide access to the main sections of the app (Tutor, Courses, Reviser, Planner, Social).
*   **Secondary Navigation (Side Menu/Drawer):** A side menu will provide access to less frequently used sections or settings (Profile, Settings, Help, About).
*   **In-Screen Navigation (Stack):** Within each main section, a stack navigator will be used to navigate between screens in a hierarchical manner.

## 5. Styling

The app will use Tailwind CSS for styling.

*   **Tailwind CSS Configuration:**
    *   A custom Tailwind CSS configuration file will be created to define the app's color palette, typography, and other design tokens.
    *   The configuration will be extended to include any custom styles or utility classes that are needed.
*   **Component Styling:**
    *   Tailwind CSS utility classes will be used to style components directly in the JSX code.
    *   Custom CSS classes will be created as needed for more complex styling scenarios.

## 6. Forms

The app will include the following forms:

*   **Login Form:**
    *   Fields: Email/Username, Password
    *   Functionality: Authenticates the user and redirects them to the main app screen.
*   **Sign-Up Form:**
    *   Fields: Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password
    *   Functionality: Creates a new user account and redirects them to the main app screen.
*   **Custom Course Request Form:**
    *   Fields: Course Name, Topic Description, Learning Goals, Preferred Learning Style
    *   Functionality: Submits a request for a custom course to be created.

## 7. Key Components

*   **Button:** A reusable button component with different styles (primary, secondary, etc.).
*   **Input:** A reusable input component with different types (text, password, email, etc.).
*   **Card:** A reusable card component for displaying content in a visually appealing way.
*   **Header:** A reusable header component for displaying the app's title and navigation elements.
*   **Footer:** A reusable footer component for displaying copyright information and other links.

## 8. State Management

*   The frontend will use a combination of local component state and a global state management solution (Redux or Zustand) to manage data.
*   Local component state will be used for simple UI-related data (e.g., form input values, toggle states).
*   A global state management solution will be used for data that needs to be shared across multiple components (e.g., user authentication status, course data).

## 9. Third-Party Libraries

*   React Navigation
*   Ant Design Mobile RN
*   Tailwind CSS
*   (Redux or Zustand - to be decided later)
*   react-native-web
